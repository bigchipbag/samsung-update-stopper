This stops the "the device will automatically restart tomorrow" or "yoU cAn OnLy PoStPonE thiS UpDaTe TWO MorE TiMES!" prompts you get from samsung

If anything, this will do exactly what LG did and give us "the newest fanciest Android OS LoTs oF bElLS anD WhiStlES!!" which ended up draining the phone battery overnight and giving janky UI performance.

Ultimately this ends up forcing you to upgrade or riskily downgrade your phone with shady tools online (depending on the phone)

I have only tested this on an S20 FE 5G and Note9, but it should work on most samsung devices, but use at your own risk

# usage

Make sure you have the adb package, debug mode enabled, and fingerprint trusted for debugging. 

If you use the debloat, make sure you have fdroid and openboard installed as it would disable samsung honeyboard keyboard. 

Run the .bat file in the ADB.exe directory

Updates will go away and you can rest easy your phone will last more than a year.

I also added an optiona debloat bat file to nuke most of the included bloatware.
